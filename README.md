<h>Description</h>
Satellite imagery is critical for a wide variety of applications from disaster management and recovery, to agriculture, to military intelligence. Clouds present a major obstacle for all of these use cases, and usually have to be identified and removed from a dataset before satellite imagery can be used. Improving methods of identifying clouds can unlock the potential of an unlimited range of satellite imagery use cases, enabling faster, more efficient, and more accurate image-based research.

<>Data Used

In this challenge, your goal is to detect cloud cover in satellite imagery to remove cloud interference. The challenge uses publicly available satellite data from the Sentinel-2 mission, which captures wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral imaging. For each tile, data is separated into different bands of light across the full visible spectrum, near-infrared, and infrared light. Data is shared through Microsoft's Planetary Computer.
