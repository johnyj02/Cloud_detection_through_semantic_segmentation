<h1>Description</h1>

Satellite imagery is critical for a wide variety of applications from disaster management and recovery, to agriculture, to military intelligence. Clouds present a major obstacle for all of these use cases, and usually have to be identified and removed from a dataset before satellite imagery can be used. Improving methods of identifying clouds can unlock the potential of an unlimited range of satellite imagery use cases, enabling faster, more efficient, and more accurate image-based research.

<h1>Data Used</h1>
The data is sourced from publicly available satellite data from the Sentinel-2 mission which captures wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral imaging. The data for 12 bands of data are available in  Microsoft's Planetary Computer
